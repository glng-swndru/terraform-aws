# Learning Infrastructure as Code (IaC) with Terraform & AWS

This repository is created as part of the learning journey in **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)** using **Terraform** to manage infrastructure on AWS.

## What is Terraform?
Terraform is an **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)** tool that allows us to manage cloud resources such as **EC2, S3, VPC, IAM**, and more using a **declarative approach**.

## Installation
### Install Terraform
1. **Download Terraform**: [Terraform Downloads](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/downloads)
2. **Verify installation**:
   ```sh
   terraform version
   ```

### Install AWS CLI
Since Terraform is used to manage AWS resources, make sure **AWS CLI** is installed:
1. **Download AWS CLI**: [AWS CLI Installation](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/)
2. **Configure credentials**:
   ```sh
   aws configure
   ```
